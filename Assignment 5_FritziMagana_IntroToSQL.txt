--Correlated subqueries are subqueries that reference the table in
the outer query. They are used when the subquery needs to answer a problem with multiple parts and that answer depends on the results of the outer query. Inline views are subqueries in the FROM statement. It is commonly used to simplify queries that rely on complex JOIN operations and/or condensing several separate queries into a single query.

-- Correlated Subqueries example:
SELECT e.empno, e.deptno, e.ename, d1.loc
FROM emp e, dept d1
WHERE d1.loc = (SELECT d2.loc FROM dept d2 WHERE d2.deptno = e.deptno);

 -- Inline Views Example:
SELECT e.empno, e.ename, dept_info
FROM emp e,
     (
      SELECT UPPER(TRIM(dname) || ' - ' || TRIM(loc))
                AS dept_info,
             deptno
      FROM dept
     ) d
WHERE e.deptno = d.deptno;
